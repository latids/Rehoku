# Changelog

### In version 0.2.0:

Resolved the issue 'automatic suggestion of importing' specific hooks from the package. This was a recurring problem in the 'lati-hooks' as well. To address this, I remade the existing 'lati-hooks' and made adjustments to certain dependencies to ensure better compatibility among them. Additionally, the minification of the build process has been successfully implemented.
